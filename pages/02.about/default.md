Hi, I'm Łukasz Pojezierski (he/him). Yes, the letter 'L' has a stroke - this part of your screen isn’t dirty. If you're into IPA, it's /ˈwukaʂ pojeˈʑjɛrski/ you're looking for, and not a craft brew (It's the best pronunciation I could get with IPA-to-speech tools). As a courtesy to non-Polish speakers, I go by 'Lukasz' or 'Lucas', but for some reason, most people call me 'dickhead'.

Born and raised in Suwałki⏤The Alaska of Poland. Mama found me at the end of a rainbow in the late '80s. I was growing up in the '90s and early '00s, witnessing a reality vastly different from the one shown on TV. Communism lingered longer in the backwaters. But the racket of crickets mating in the wheat, the smell of lake water, and heaviness of sunbeams in August will stay with me forever.

Based in Warsaw since 2007 (minus a two-year stint back home). I love reading books, eating pizza, and riding a bicycle - not necessarily all at once.
