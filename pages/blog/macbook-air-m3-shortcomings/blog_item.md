I like apples, but my gosh, there's nothing more repulsive than biting into an overripe piece. It can ruin the whole merry, Tom-Sawyer-munching-on-Ben-Rogers'-apple experience.

## Power up on lid open / by pressing any key
Extremely annoying for people, who are not keen on an idea of their keyboard being the foundation for a fatberg. Forget about cleaning the palmrest, even if you've just powered off the MacBook.

Thankfully, there's an app for thatâ€”KeyboardCleaningTool. The title leaves little to the imagination, but the app delivers what it promises.

## Concave keys are hard to clean

I suggest getting yourself polishing cloths almost identical to those sold by Apple (buy them on [ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±Allegro](https://allegro.pl/oferta/nano-sciereczka-z-mikrofibry-szmatka-do-ekranow-dotykowych-urzadzen-apple-12480527623?utm_medium=afiliacja&utm_source=ctr_2&utm_campaign=1e285398-5bc7-46aa-bdad-e4e54c03caeb&utm_content=1137aca3c0d4#) or anywhere elseâ€”look for "Polishing cloth compatible with Apple". Yes, it does sound ridiculous indeed.
