Have you ever gotten stuck on an idea, kept at it nonstop, only to realize it was all pointless from the very start?

So I've been thinking a lot lately. (What a terrible punchline.)

My relationship with blogging is of the Rachel-and-Ross variety: dysfunctional back-and-forth dynamic, stream-of-consciousness epistolography, and occasional elopements (while ignoring the fact the paramour usually gives no dowry). Yes, we were on the break. Since 2013, I have not written anything that resembles an actual piece. 

The very faint feeling I kept on a shelf began glowing. Again. It has been percolating for quite some time, and I can no longer delay the tea time. There you go. Pojezierski's back in town, bay-bay!

Where the heck are your previous entries, dating back to 2002, you may ask? 2002, the time when Dollar Store Eminem knock-offs were window-shopping Nokia phones with color LCD? Well, they are lost in time, like tears in rain. Thinking back on those outpourings, let me just say: you're welcome. Gladly, no one will ever care to browse the Wayback Machine in the (ig)noble quest to bring them back from the abyss.

This time, I'll be stretching my proficiency in the King's (if the King was a first-generation immigrant middle schooler). Why? Why not! I believe it is a great way to practice expression in a foreign language. I am a lifelong admirer of anglophony, but not too capable of talking, writing, or understanding English. Actually, I don't understand what I am writing right now.

Anywho, sit back, relax, and enjoy the non-invasive lobotomy! I have a good feeling about this.
