I was there far into the off-season, so it’s fair to assume that Como is a different place during the warmer months. Yet, Como captivates year-round, so even in late Fall you can see why so many celebs and the nouveau riche are drawn to its shores. You can get a taste of their high life without draining your wallet―but don’t get too excited; you’re still a pleb.
